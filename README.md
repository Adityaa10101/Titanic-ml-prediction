# 🛳️ Titanic - Machine Learning from Disaster

This is my first end-to-end ML project based on the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle.

## 🔍 Problem Statement
Predict whether a passenger survived or not based on features like age, class, gender, etc.

## 🧠 Workflow
- Data Cleaning & Null Handling
- Feature Engineering (Title extraction, encoding)
- Model Training with XGBoost
- Accuracy on test data: ~62.2%
- Submission file generated

## 📁 Files
- `Titanic.ipynb` → Main notebook
- `submission.csv` → Final predictions for Kaggle submission

## 🚀 Future Plans
- Try other models (RandomForest, Logistic Regression)
- Improve feature engineering (family size, ticket group)
- Hyperparameter tuning
- Boost accuracy

### 🧠 Lessons Learned
This project taught me about EDA, preprocessing, one-hot encoding, model training, and submission formatting.
